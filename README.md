# Sublime Text package for Rust

## About

This package supports current rust at the time of writing;
it makes no attempt at backwards compatibility.
This is intended to be a feature - if keywords no longer highlight,
it means that the keyword has changed or will soon

## Installation

Install the Package Control package if you haven't got it yet. Package 
Control is the best way to install packages for Sublime Text. See 
http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation for 
instructions.

Open the palette (`control+shift+P` or `command+shift+P`) in Sublime Text
and select `Package Control: Install Package` and then select `Rust` from 
the list. That's it.
